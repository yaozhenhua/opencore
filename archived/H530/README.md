This is the EFI folder for booting up macOS on Lenovo H530 desktop (Intel i3 CPU). Because the iGPU cannot support 4k
resolution without changing DVMT in BIOS, which isn't supported, it looks odd connecting to 4k monitor. Additionally,
the BIOS doesn't boot from UEFI on the SSD properly and only booting from USB drive works reliably. Therefore, this
setup has been abandoned.
